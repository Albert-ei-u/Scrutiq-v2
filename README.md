## What is Scrutiq?

Scrutiq is a full-stack AI-assisted resume screening and applicant ranking platform. Recruiters define job specifications — required skills, experience, qualifications — and Scrutiq uses Google Gemini to analyze uploaded resumes, score each candidate against those criteria, and produce a ranked shortlist automatically.

Built as part of the **Umurava 2026** challenge.

## 🤖 AI Decision Flow

The AI logic in Scrutiq is split into two critical phases: **Extraction** and **Screening**.

### 1. Profile Extraction (Unstructured to Structured)
When a resume (PDF/Word) is uploaded, the system:
- Extracts raw text using `pdf-parse` or `mammoth`.
- Sends the text to Gemini with a specialized prompt to populate the **Umurava Talent Profile Schema**.
- Identifies semantic duplicates to prevent profile stagnation.

### 2. Technical Screening (Ranking & Scoring)
During the screening phase, the AI evaluates candidates against a specific job requirement matrix using a **weighted rubric**:
- **Relevant Experience (30pts):** Matching years and relevance of previous roles.
- **Proof of Results (25pts):** Looking for quantified achievements.
- **Skills Match (25pts):** Calculating the overlap between job requirements and candidate skills.
- **Clarity & Professionalism (10pts):** Evaluating the quality of the resume content.
- **Extras (10pts):** Certifications, portfolios, and unique projects.

**Explainability:** For every candidate, the AI generates natural-language reasoning covering specific **Strengths** and **Weaknesses**, ensuring recruiters remain in control of the final hiring decision.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or higher
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v9 or higher
- A [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) instance (local or Atlas)
- A [Google Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/achille010/scrutiq.git
cd scrutiq
```

### 2. Install all dependencies

```bash
npm install
cd client && npm install && cd ..
cd server && npm install && cd ..
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

You need two `.env` files — one for the server and one for the client. See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section below.

### 4. Start the development server

This starts both the frontend and backend together:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend: `http://localhost:5000` (or your configured `PORT`)

---

## Environment Variables

### Server — `server/.env`

```env
# Server
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

# Database
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string-here

# Google Gemini AI
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here

# CORS — URL of your frontend
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Email (Nodemailer)
EMAIL_USER=your-email-address-here
EMAIL_PASS=your-email-app-password-here

# Auth
JWT_SECRET=your-long-random-secret-here
```

### Client — `client/.env`

```env
# URL of your backend API
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

> **Never commit `.env` files.** Both are already listed in `.gitignore`.

---

## Available Scripts

Run these from the **root** of the project:

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Starts both frontend and backend together |
| `npm run frontend` | Starts only the React dev server |
| `npm run backend` | Starts only the Express server |

---

## 📝 Assumptions & Limitations
- **File Types:** Currently supports PDF and DOCX for resumes.
- **Language:** Optimized for English language profiles and job descriptions.
- **Token Limits:** Screens candidates in batches to respect Gemini API rate limits.
